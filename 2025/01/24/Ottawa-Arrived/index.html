        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since my last post… There are some drafts (actually, only one) that I wrote during this time, but I’ll never finish them since I just deleted them. As the title suggests, yes, I’m finally here.</p>
<p>For the outbound journey, I put considerable effort into creating a backup plan in case any unexpected issues arose at customs, such as them not recognizing my student status after being on leave for so long. I kept this change very quiet, only informing my leader. I also managed to secure approval from HR to retain my position until I entered Canada. I worked up until the day before my flight, ensuring that if the worst-case scenario occurred at customs, I could still return and continue working. No celebrations, no vacation.</p>
<p>However, nothing happened. The CBSA didn’t even ask a single question. Two years of delay, and nobody cared. I don’t know if I should be happy about how smooth it went or feel something else entirely.</p>
<p>Now it’s been three weeks since then. Sometimes I sit near the window, looking out at the city—which isn’t exactly fancy but different from my hometown—and still wonder if I’m in a dream. Honestly, it’s good that I’m here. If I’d stayed in that position, I would have wasted my youth and probably burned out within a few years. But Ottawa—it’s just not exactly what I imagined.</p>
<p>I find that there’s nowhere to go in this city. It’s weird because I’m someone who is naturally curious and loves exploring new places. Before this, whenever I arrived in a city like Beijing or Chongqing, I was fully interested in finding a destination, pinning it on the map, and walking there just to see what it looked like. I’m not saying I’ve already lost my curiosity about Ottawa—no, that’s not it. Like I said, it does feel different from anywhere I’ve been before in China. But it feels like fruit that’s been frozen in the fridge. It’s still fresh, and it stays that way, but you just can’t taste the freshness.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m blaming the snow here. There’s snow everywhere. I’m from a northern city in China, and in my hometown, snow is something you encounter once or twice a year, maybe a few times, but it’s rare enough to feel lovely. Here in Ottawa, I’ve seen more snow in a single week than I did in my entire life before this. Though I still enjoy grabbing handfuls of snow and walking through untouched snowfields, I’ve noticed that a lot of people here don’t care about such things. And snow sticks to everything. Any color covered in white eventually turns grey. The red of bricks, the black of cars, the green of trees… all grey. Through my window, Ottawa becomes a grey city. It can be a bit depressing, isn’t it?</p>
<p>I feel a little isolated, and I know my language skills are weak. It’s good that I’m aware of what I need to do. I’ve only enrolled in one course this semester because I’m afraid my English won’t be able to keep up, but for this course, I’m doing well so far. This master’s program is still a challenge due to the tight time limits, but I’ll keep going.</p>
<p>This blog has turned into a diary, so let it be.</p>
